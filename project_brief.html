								<h1>Project Brief</h1>
								<p>This describes the problem or opportunity that we plan to address in our UX Design projec</p>
							</header>
							<h3>What is the problem in brief?</h3>
							<p>The user group we are targeting is the elderly who has the needs to use riding-sharing services. We realized that despite the huge demand of ride-sharing in the olderly community, the current ride-sharing platforms (such as Uber & Lyft) are not well designed for them navigate. The elderly often experience hardship finding key information, communicating with their driver, finding locations, etc. while using the app. Thus, we intend to provide an effortless solution that better suits the ride-sharing needs for the elderly.</p>
							<h3>How will your project change the status quo? For whom?</h3>
							<p>Our project will help make using the ride share service more accessible for the elderly. Currently they will have problems when the car that they order is not accessible to them or the App is confusing for them to navigate, and we hope to address these two problems and make the user experience more fluid and intuitive. This will also help the children of the elderly since now they don’t need to worry about their parents not being able to travel. </p>
							<h3>What is (at least) one naïve design idea (rough sketch)? How does this idea address what you see as the core problem?</h3>
							<p>Uber with less options and bigger font. Make everything more straight forward. Also add voice assistant to everything. Just think a very, very simple platform that's easy to understand and use.</p>
							<h3>What information do you need to collect? How will you collect it? How will you meet your target users, or who can serve as effective proxies for them?</h3>
							<p>We need to collect information on how older people interact with ride sharing apps. We will collect this information by going retirement homes as well as contacting elderly relatives of fellow students. We don’t anticipate issues with accessing our target users, in our experience, people at retirement homes are very happy to talk to “younger people”.</p>
							<h3>How will your team work together to accomplish these goals (as well as your individual learning goals)?</h3>
							<p>We will all collaborate and bounce all ideas off of one another. WE will have weekly meetings where we will delegate tasks, work on assignments and check on one another's work. By having everyone's eyes and input on everything we will be able to achieve the best possible interface that we can.</p>
