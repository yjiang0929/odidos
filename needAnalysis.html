								<h1>Need Analysis Phase</h1>
								<p>This is where we synthesized our discovery findings and created a report addressing the needs and values of your prospective users.</p>
							</header>
							<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
							<p>The user group we are targeting is the elderly who has the needs to use riding-sharing services. We realized that despite the huge demand of ride-sharing in the olderly community, the current ride-sharing platforms (such as Uber & Lyft) are not well designed for them navigate. The elderly often experience hardship finding key information, communicating with their driver, finding locations, etc. while using the app. Thus, we intend to provide an effortless solution that better suits the ride-sharing needs for the elderly.</p>

							<h3>Who Matters?</h3>
							<p>On the customer end, we are focusing on elderly people exclusively. We are assuming that the back end of our design caters to ederly people so that we can design a user interface where the only users are elderly people.</p>
							<p>Elderly customer’s family. Having an elderly family member you are always considered something may happen to them when they are out and about. Because of this we will integrate a ride tracking feature that notifies and updates family members on the users where abouts. Letting them know that their loved one makes it from point A to point B safely.</p>
							<p>Ride-sharing drivers. The drivers of this platform are very important. The easier to use the app is for the drivers the less discrepancies in pick up location and overall problems will occur. By providing accurate and up to date data for drivers that are made aware of their passengers limitations the ride sharing service because much more efficient for both the drivers and riders.</p>

							<h3>Interaction with Prospective Users</h3>
							<p>Based on data we have gained from the 4 interviews conducted with people from out potential user group (70+ years old people with needs for ride-sharing service), we used the people portraits and personas to reflect how our prospective users experience and think about this problem in their life, as shown in the following diagram.</p>

							<h3>People Portraits</h3>

							</div>

							<h3>Requirement for Solution</h3>
							<p>The solution must have a simple user interface where the core functions are easy to find because our target personas are not familiar with new technologies and have trouble navigating in apps. A successful implementation of this feature will ensure that our target personas can achieve their desired function in a few clicks and won’t feel frustrated looking for the correct button to press.</p>
							<p>The solution should incorporate an onboarding session for new users or new features. Phone apps nowadays have regular updates and the added features can be overwhelming for our targeted personas. We plan to have an onboarding session for our app users the first time they open the application or when a new feature is released. This will make sure that our targeted users understand what and where the ride-share functions are in the app and reduce resistance maneuvering the app.  
							</p>
							<p>The solution should have a smart location choice feature for the elderly. One problem mentioned in many of our interviews was that the GPS was inaccurate and placed the pick-up location far away. Because our targeted personas have mobility concerns, they can spend a long time walking there, which can lead to a frustrating experience or even a canceled ride. Our solution is that their family or elderly family crew can help them set up a convenient pick-up location for ride-share pick up. In the future when they hire a ride-share, the app will automatically use this location for pick-up to reduce the hassle of them trying to figure out the map pin-point when calling a ride.
							</p>

							<h3>Impact of Successful Solutions</h3>
							<p>A successful user interface would significantly improve the elder users’ experience on ordering rides, providing them a convenient, safe, and effortless ride-sharing experience.	With a successful design of the user interface, older users would be able to accurately input the exact information drivers need to pick up at the right location and improve their service quality for users with special needs.</p>
							<p>For the users, a successful solution can minimize frustration and confusion caused by poor navigating and interface. Elder users should be able to clearly identify which step they are at in the ordering process and what information they are giving to the drivers. They should also be able to have a clear understanding of their payment methods and price structure if they want. As of our knowledge from the interviews, lots of the potential elder users are hesitant to use ride-sharing services due to the complication in the app interface. Thus, a successful design of user interface may mitigate elder users’ fear to use ride-sharing service and largely improve their quality of life through serving their transportation needs.</p>
							<p>For the drivers, a successful user interface would not only help them capture the information they need for their services in the most efficient and accurate manner, but also present the route and special needs instructions in the most driver-friendly way. Successful user interface would also allow the drivers to communicate the users timely and smoothly for any changes and questions. More importantly, a smooth and effortless ride-sharing experience will also largely increase the number of drivers who are willing to serve elder users with special needs, benefiting the community as a whole.</p>
