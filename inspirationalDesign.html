							<h3>AARP NOW</h3>
							<p>AARP NOW is a phone app targeted at the senior user group. This app is associated with the American Association of Retired Persons and releases senior specific news and events to its users. Since this app has a wide senior user base and is liked by most of the users according to online reviews, it makes sense to study the app to see what features are appreciated by the senior that we can also apply in our interface design.</p> 
							<p>An important part about this interface is that the components are distinctly color coded. This makes it easier for the elderly to navigate inside the app. If all of the interface are uniformly colored, the users can have difficulty finding their desired function. By having colored components, users can gradually build an association between the function and the color and therefore navigate the app much faster. In our interface design, we should try to colorfy the page to improve our user’s efficiency when using the app.</p>
							<p>Another spotlight from this app is that it features a list of local events that are interesting to the elderly. Senior people living in assistive housing may not have too much knowledge about the events in the neighborhood, and showing this list of events can help them find enjoyable things to do. In our ride-share app for the senior, we can also feature a selection of events for our users, so that the users can directly look for local events on the app and use the transportation service to get there.</p>

							<h3>LYFT</h3>
							<p>Lyft is a ride sharing app that connects drivers with riders with competitive prices. The platform has changed the way people get from point A to point B. The app itself has a fun and engaging interface that encourages you to explore while guiding you to the next step. For many the interface is straightforward and easy to navigate but this isn't the case for everybody. The younger generations excel with technology and using applications but the senior class does not. It's a new breed to them and one they struggle to fully grasp. Something that seems easy and straightforward to a 20 or even 50 year old will not be for a 70 or 80 year old. At times the app feels over complicated with clusters of information on the screen at once. This paired with the reduced text size make for a troublesome situation for senior citizens. On top of this platform fails to provide a clear and direct meeting sight that is required for the driver or is fully determined by the rider. The platform also fails to provide notice to the driver that their passenger is a senior citizen and may need additional help throughout the pick up and drop off process. By looking at Lyft’s interface it's easy to see where improvements could be made. By making the dashboard and options reduced and enlarging the text and icons it would provide for an easier to navigate interface. ONe were senior citizens would excel.</p>

							<h3>Car Finder</h3>
							<p>Car Finder AR is an Android app developed by Hexter Lab Software that helps users find where they parked their car using AR technology. The app remembers where you parked your car utilizing google maps, which is not a unique feature. What is unique is its use of AR to guide the user to their parked car. This kind of interface is theoretically useful for senior citizens who might have a hard time tracking themselves on a conventional map software. This sort of interface could be applicable to ride sharing software to help users find their pickup location.</p>
