								<h1>Final Refinement Phase</h1>
								<p>This is our final iteration including a project summary and a design recommendation. </p>
							</header>
							<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
							<p>Ryde, an Odidos app, is a user focused ridesharing platform that specializes on the elderly customer. We recognized a gap in the ride sharing market for elderly users and have focused our resources to create a platform that capitalizes, both users needs and profitability. The current ride sharing platforms Uber & Lyft are not well designed for elderly users to Navigate and therefore mis the entire elderly market. The elderly often experience hardship finding key information, communicating with their driver, finding locations, etc. while using the app. Ryde will be the solution to all of these problems. The first elderly facing ride sharing platform that focuses on adaptability. Our design aims to make the process simple and easy to understand. It makes the ride-sharing experience as linear as possible, communicating which choices have been made clearly through visual consistency, text stylization and intentional positioning. </p>
							<div class="image">

							</div>
							<p>The elderly community has talked and we listened. We have run through iterations of every component of our platform with target customers to make sure no egg laid unturned. We eliminated all of the nonsense of traditional ride sharing platforms and made it just what the customer needs. </p>

							<h3>Design Rationale</h3>
							<p>The team developed the final version of the user interface for Ryde during this phase. Many design choices that we made in Ryde stemmed from heuristic reviews from other teams and our own usability studies. We would like to illustrate our final interface design below along with the rationales behind each page’s design.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_2.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>The above screen is the starting page of the Ryde app. From our initial interaction with our elderly user base, we gathered that the elderly usually had trouble typing long locations on their phone. This could result in repeated effort and frustration in the app. To reduce the stress for typing the location on the spot when calling a ride, we designed the app interface centered around the voice input option. On this page, users can press the microphone button to record a message about the trip details and the backend will parse the message and automatically fill in the location information. They can also see how many drivers are nearby to get an estimate of how fast they will be picked up after requesting a ride. On the top left corner, the users can access their profile page to change their contact and payment information. For those who are more comfortable with text input, they can click on the switch on the top of the screen to switch to text mode.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_3.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>This screen follows the initial voice input page. After the microphone button is pressed, the interface will change into fluid shape indicating that now the users can speak about the location information about their ride. This page is included to provide users with sufficient feedback to guide them through the interface. The instruction about what to say remains on this page to tell users about what to say to the system. </p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_4.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>After users have finished their voice input, the app will detect the pause and present the confirm page. This page will include the information gathered from the voice input, including the origin and destination, departure time and any special needs. The information boxes are shaped like text box and allow users to correct the information on this page. If they are not satisfied with the results, the users can click on cancel and return to the starting page. After the users have confirmed the trip details, they can click confirm to proceed to the “Waiting for ride” page. This confirmation is designed to look similar to the “Text input” page to preserve consistency within the app and allow the users to learn the app faster. </p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_5.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>This is the page for entering a Ryde request through text. A user enters the location they want to be picked up from in the “FROM:” text box. The user also enters the location they want to be driven to in the “TO:” text box. Once both boxes have been filled the application brings the user to the text confirmation screen. If the user has changed their mind about using text input and wishes to use voice instead, they can click on the Talk/Text switch at the top of the screen to bring them to the voice input screen discussed previously.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_6.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>This is the text confirmation screen. The ride information that had been inputted on the previous screen is shown here. The purpose of this screen is to allow the user to review the information they have inputted and confirm that it is correct. The user can also specify when they want to be picked up and if they have a special need that needs to be accommodated for such as a wheelchair. If there is a special need, an appropriate Ryde driver will be selected. Once the user has reviewed the information they can press the confirm button to move onto the next screen. If they changed their mind about ordering a ride, they can press the cancel button to cancel the ride.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_7.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>This is the waiting screen while the platform finds the perfect ride for the user. As we did with all of the pages we wanted to focus on making the page as simple and clean as possible. We did so by only putting crucial information on the page in a linear design and using colors to help differentiate the different buttons and information. By using color and bigger font sizes the elderly customer will be able to best navigate the page and know how to do what they are trying.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_8.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>This is the screen that indicates the platform has found the user a driver and they are on their way. We tell them where the driver is with the map which will also convey the drivers ETA, the drivers picture with his rating, the type and color of the drivers car and lastly a big red cancel ride button for easy changing of plans. We landed on this design by many user interviews, they all indicated that the information on the screen is the only info we need. By listening to the users we are able to lock in on a design that is exactly what we need.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_9.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>This is the “in ride” page. It indicates to the rider where they are, how far away they are, how to change the destination and what to do if there is an emergency. Again we used a linear design focused around simplicity. There is only the information the user needs on the screen which allows for easy, quick access to the important features which stop the user from getting lost in the interface. This page also utilizes color coordination to help convey which button does what.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_10.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>This is the screen that is brought up if the “I have an Emergency” button is pressed during the ride. Two main scenarios were kept in mind while designing this page. The first was where the “I have an Emergency” button was pressed accidentally, and wants to exit this screen. The second was where the button was pressed on purpose, and wants to call 911 as soon as possible. To balance these two scenarios, the has a timer that then calls a Ryde representative after a certain amount of time. This is so that if a user presses the emergency button accidentally they have time to cancel before a representative is called. A “Dial 911 Now” button is present so that if there is an emergency and it is urgent, the call to the Ryde representative will be bypassed and a 911 call is available immediately.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_11.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>If the user decides to change destination, this pages is easily visible and accessible from the “En-route” page, by clicking the “change destination” button. In this screen, the user is provided their current location and a text-field right below to enter their new location. In addition, as one of the potential users pointed out during the refinement phase, we have added the change in “Price” and “Time” for the new location which were considered very important for many users.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_12.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>Upon completion of the ride, users are given the option to rate their driver’s service. We have broken down the overall rating into four categories which were considered the top-4 most important factors of ride service quality from our interview. In addition, from the usability test, we have also discovered that the 5-star categorized rating system yields higher participation rate, efficiency, and comprehensiveness compared to other means of feedback-providing system.</p>
							<div class="image">
								<img src="images/finalref_13.png" alt="" width="200" /></a>
							</div>
							<p>This is the last page of a complete ride service user experience. Users will be notified of their successful completion of trip and submission of feedback. There is also a button to easily map them back to the Home page for another ride.</p>

							<h3>Future Works</h3>
							<p>Overall, the team feels satisfied to arrive at this final version of the Ryde app after many iterations of change, but there are a few things that the team would hope to finish if there were more time for this project.</p>
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
								<li>We hope to design a complete profile page. Because this project was mostly focused on improving the ride sharing experience, the team spent most of the time refining this part of the app and didn’t have enough time to make a complete profile page. We hope to have the functions of changing contact and payment information and viewing past trips in the “Profiles” page.</li>
								<li>We hope to conduct more usability studies to gather more significant feedback about the design of our app. Due to the limitation of time, we only interviewed a few people for the formal usability study and changed our app based on their feedback. The team is aware that this can just be the personal preferences of the people that we interviewed and we would like to interview more people to get more representative data to guide the design of our app.</li>
								<li>We hope to design an interface for the driver’s side. The current Ryde interface focused on the experience of the elderly riders, our primary user group. But the driver’s side is also an important aspect of the ride sharing experience and has an impact on how popular our app can be. Some of the feedback that we gathered from usability study also led us to have some feature requirements for the driver’s app, such as displaying the emergency options when the riders click on the “I have an emergency” button. If we had more time, we would want to finish a mock-up interface for the driver’s app and run usability test as well. </li>
