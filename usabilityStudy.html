								<h1>Formal Usability Study</h1>
								<p>This is when we conducted a formal usability study to test our interface. </p>
							</header>

							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>Our formal usability study centers around our app’s feedback and review functionalities. We have gotten design feedback from our peers that the feedback page is hard to navigate, and want to discover an implementation of the feedback page that is most efficient to go through and most effective for our users to provide feedback. We also want to test the emergency call function to make sure the emergency button can function without being too daunting to use. </p>

							<h3>Hypothesis:</h3>
							<ol type="1">
								<li>Feedback system with no text or voice input, such as a five-star rating system, help elderly users get through the feedback pages faster while allowing them to provide sufficient review. </li>
								<li>Medical call system that does not require additional user input is more effective in emergency situations. </li>
							</ol>

							<h3>Implementation for hypothesis (1):</h3>
							<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
								<li>Independent Variable (x): 
									<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
										<li>How users input their feedback (voice or star system)</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Dependent Variable (y):
									<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
										<li>The number of users participated in the feedback process (versus skipped)</li>
										<li>The response time</li>
										<li>The comprehensiveness of the feedback</li>
										<li>The clarity of the feedback </li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Constant Variable (c):
									<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
										<li>Mapping to the feedback page</li>
										<li>Driver evaluated</li>
										<li>Color scheme of the interface</li>
										<li>Visibility of buttons</li>
										<li>Loading time for next page</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We will design two versions of the feedback-giving interfaces (A/B) for our usability test. The feedback back comes right after the user completes the trip with the driver and exits the vehicle. </p>
							<p>In version A, users will have a large button for voice input on the screen: users can press down to verbally communicate their input to the driver; as a result, both the audio and transcript file of the feedback will be given to both the driver and the company for evaluation and improvement. </p>
							<p>In version B, users will have a 5-star rating system (as most commonly adopted for modern evaluation interface). We have break down the overall rating to 4 main categories: cleanliness, ride quality, attitude, and promptness. Users will have to individually rate each category.</p>

							<h3>Study Result (1):</h3>
							<h4>Observation Overview</h4>
							<p>We conducted the A/B testing for the 5-star rating system versus the voice-input system with 3 potential users. Overall, there was a shared preference for 5-star rating system, as they responded that it is more comprehensive, convenient, and consistent. The very fact that the voice input option required most users to take an extra effort to “draft a little speech” (quote from a participant) made the process relatively difficult for older users. When providing feedback, all the users resonated that they wanted to provide something that was actually useful in helping the driver to improve their service quality, and the 5-star review system (by categories) just served this purpose more effectively and comprehensively.</p>
							<h4>Variables</h4>
							<table style="width:100%">
								<tr>
								  <th> </th>
								  <th>Voice Input</th>
								  <th>5-Star Categorized Review</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
								  <td>Participation Rate (vs. Skip)</td>
								  <td>2/3</td>
								  <td>3/3</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
								  <td>Avg. Response Time</td>
								  <td>37 seconds</td>
								  <td>7.5 seconds</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Avg. Comprehensiveness</td>
									<td>3.6</td>
									<td>4.0</td>
								  </tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Avg. Clarity</td>
									<td>4.3</td>
									<td>3.3</td>
								</tr>
							  </table>
							  <p>* Comprehensiveness and clarity is subjectively evaluated on a 5-pts scale, with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best</p>

							  <h4>Interpretation</h4>
							  <p>There was a significantly better willingness to participation in 5-Star Categorized Review System, compared with the Voice Input System. The reason was likely to be that the 5-Star Review System just takes 4 simple clicks whereas the voice input demands more bainwork and eloquence. The convenience of the 5-Star Review System also contributed to the decrease in Avg. response time.</p>
							  <p>Moreover, we noticed that, in the audio input test, people’s feedback was often short and concise, describing only an overall experience and lacking a structured, systematic way of evaluating the service. They would only mention specific things is there was certain aspect of the service that stood out to them. Comparatively, due to the already posted structure, the 5-Star Review System provided more comprehensive and constructive feedback to the drivers. However, we noticed that the voice input did tend to have high clarity as drivers would receive actionable feedback on very specific things they can improve on. In this sense, the solely numeric feedback generated from the 5-Star System do lacks clarity, which created an interesting trade-off.</p>

							  <h4>Implementation</h4>
							  <p>From the usability test, we decided to implement the 5-Star Categorized Review System because of its higher rate of participation, better efficiency, and more comprehensiveness in terms of the quality of review. The decision process also echoed the general response from the test group. Nonetheless, we still do recognize the trade-off of a standardized rating system, including the difference in criteria, lack of clarity and specification, etc. We will be continuously improving the feedback system for the final review in order to incorporate more clarity and provide more actionable feedback for drivers’ future service.</p>

							  <h3>Implementation for hypothesis (2):</h3>
							  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
								<li>Independent Variable (x): 
									<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
										<li>Follow-up action after pressing the emergency button</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Dependent Variable (y):
									<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
										<li>How comfortable the user is with pressing emergency button</li>
										<li>Clarity of feedback</li>
										<li>Ease of cancellation</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Constant Variable (c):
									<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
										<li>Mapping to the emergency page</li>
										<li>Color scheme of the interface</li>
										<li>Visibility of buttons</li>
										<li>Loading time for next page</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We will also design two versions of the emergency call interfaces for our usability test: </p>
							<p>In version A, users will be shown a list of medical emergency options before proceeding to the emergency calling page. This will serve as an extra round of check before confirming the emergency situation.</p>
							<p>In version B, users will be immediately prompted into an emergency call page after pressing the emergency call button. The emergency call page will have a cancel button in case of accidental press. </p>

							<h3>Study Result (2):</h3>
							<h4>Observation Overview</h4>
							<p>We conducted an A/B testing for the emergency call systems with 4 potential users. 2 users were given the emergency options interface while the 2 others were given the interface where the app directly initiates an emergency call after pressing the button. The users were asked to give a rating for their comfortness with emergency button, clarity of feedback and ease of cancellation after they experienced the whole app’s workflow. The elderly users liked having a direct call after pressing the emergency button because they said they didn’t like to, quote, “select from a million options I can’t even understand”. But the emergency options did provide the user with better clarity of what emergency situation they were calling about, and the two users who were presented with the direct call option expressed they didn’t fully understand what or who they app was calling. The group presented with emergency options said that cancellation with the emergency options felt natural, but the other group said that with the count down page on the direct call version, cancellation felt very stressful and if they accidentally pressed the button, they might panic about what to do and how to cancel. </p>

							<h4>Variables</h4>
							<table style="width:100%">
								<tr>
								  <th> </th>
								  <th>Emergency Options</th>
								  <th>Direct call</th>
								</tr>
								<tr>
								  <td>Comfortness with emergency button</td>
								  <td>3.0</td>
								  <td>3.75</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
								  <td>Clarity of feedback</td>
								  <td>4.25</td>
								  <td>3.5</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>Ease of cancellation</td>
									<td>4.5</td>
									<td>3.5</td>
								  </tr>
							  </table>
							  <p>* All the variables are subjectively evaluated on a 5-pts scale, with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best</p>

							  <h4>Interpretation</h4>
							  <p>From our interaction with the potential users about the emergency call button, we think there was an agreement that having options for the emergency call was very important. Without the options, the users could feel uncomfortable about whether they were calling the correct person for help. There did seem to be a slight preference for the direct call version due to its effectiveness. The users thought that in an emergent situation, they would not have time to carefully select an option but would prefer to call directly and cancel later. This meant that the situation that we ended up implementing should keep some of the simplicity of the direct call button. However, the team realized that because we only had time to conduct usability studies with 4 users, their opinions might not be representative of our entire user group. If we were given more time for this project, we would like to conduct more comprehensive user tests to validate our assumption.</p>

							  <h4>Implementation</h4>
							  <p>From the usability study, we would like to keep the direct call button on the rider side to maintain the simplicity and comfortness that our users felt during the usability test. And if we had more time to develop the driver side app interface, we would build an emergency options page on the driver’s side. The emergency options will pop up after the rider has pressed the emergency call button and the driver can pull over to the side and select the appropriate emergency option for the rider after asking. Because there are certain aspects of both emergency call options that our users liked, we think this implementation is a good way to capture the advantages of both the emergency options and the direct call. </p>
