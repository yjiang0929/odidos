								<h1>Consent Narrative</h1>
								<p>This is a brief document suitable for sharing with prospective users and interviewees. It explains who we are, what we are doing, what we want from them, and any risks or benefits to them.</p>
							</header>
							<p>To whom it may concern,</p>

							<p>We are a team of students from Olin College of Engineering and Babson College currently enrolled in a class called User Experience Design. We are working on a project that aims to improve ride-share software (eg:Uber, Lyft) for elderly people. Our goal, at the end of the project, is to design a new user interface with better flow, navigation, communication capabilities and suitabilities for elder users. Thus, we want to understand your experience with the current ride-sharing platforms. </p>

							<p>For this purpose, we would like to have an interview with you for 30 to 45 minutes about your experience with the current platforms, which would tremendously help us sympathize with your pain-points. With your consent, we would potentially like to collect data through photos, voice and video recordings, and written notes from the interview. We will ask for your approval before engaging in any of the above activities and consent to one data collection technique does not imply approval to other ones.</p>

							<p>Your privacy is our priority. We will use pseudonymous in all written records and any sensitive information will only be known and shared among the team. Please let us know at any point during our interview if you hesitate in agreeing, and we will work with you to address these concerns.</p>

							<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at ntan@olin.edu or 339-368-9554.</p>

							<p>Thank you,</p>
							<p>Griffin, Nathaniel, Yichen, Yulin</p>
